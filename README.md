KiCAD Utilities

These are utilities I find useful in near constant use of KiCAD in professional design projects.

* ku-refdes.py - convert a PCBnew file into an assembly file with reference designators centered and oriented on their components with the option to push them to their appropriate fab layers. This program is very simple and does little in the way of error checking. But it is very fast.
